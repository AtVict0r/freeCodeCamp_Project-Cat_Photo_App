# Cat Photo App - Responsive Web Design Project

## Project Description

This repository contains my implementation of the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Project - Cat Photo App. In this project, I built a simple web page that showcases cat photos, provides a list of things cats love and hate, and allows users to submit their own cat photos through a form.

## Project Requirements

To successfully complete this project, the following requirements from freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Certification were fulfilled:

1. Create a page with a main heading, indicating the app's name.
2. Display a section with cat photos and provide a link to view more photos.
3. Present a list of things that cats love, using an unordered list.
4. Include a figure with an image and caption related to things cats love.
5. Display a list of things that cats hate, using an ordered list.
6. Include another figure with an image and caption related to things cats hate.
7. Implement a form allowing users to submit cat photos with the following fields:
   - Indoor or outdoor cat (radio buttons).
   - Cat's personality (checkboxes).
   - Cat photo URL (text input).
   - Submit button.
